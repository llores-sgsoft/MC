  In order to test "mrp_servicemc" module, I start with confirm state, and start servicemc.
-
  I confirm servicemc order for Invoice Method 'No Invoice'.
-
  !workflow {model: mrp.servicemc, action: servicemc_confirm, ref: mrp_servicemc_rmrp1}
-
  I start the servicemcing  process by clicking on "Start servicemc" button for Invoice Method 'No Invoice'.
-
  !workflow {model: mrp.servicemc, action: servicemc_ready, ref: mrp_servicemc_rmrp1}
-
  I check its state which is in "Under servicemc".
-
  !assert {model: mrp.servicemc, id: mrp_servicemc_rmrp1}:
      - state == 'under_servicemc'
-
  servicemcing process for product is in Done state and I end this process by clicking on "End servicemc" button.
-
  !workflow {model: mrp.servicemc, action: action_servicemc_end, ref: mrp_servicemc_rmrp1}
-
  I define Invoice Method 'No Invoice' option in this servicemc order.
  So, I check that Invoice should not be created for this servicemc order.
-
  !python {model: mrp.servicemc}: |
     servicemc_id = self.browse(cr, uid, [ref('mrp_servicemc_rmrp1')], context=context)[0]
     assert not servicemc_id.invoice_id.id, _("Invoice should not be exists for this servicemc order")
